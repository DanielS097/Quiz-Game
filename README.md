# Quizz-Game

## What is this app?
This is a Quiz Game that test someone's knowledge about cars.

## What motivated me to create this app?
The motivation behind this app was the complexity that this app needed to be created. Even though is just a Quiz Game it was challenging to create.

## Who can use it?
This app can be used by anyone who wants to understand better how to deal with local storage and how JSON can be used and extremely helpful.

## What were the challenges that were faced?
I found it quite complicated to make sure that the scores get saved in the local storage but also clear them as the user wants to. It was extremely challenging to keep track of everything.

## How were these challenges overcame?
I overcame these challenges by breaking all issues into smaller pieces and figure them each individually and trying to solve them one by one and test them.

## Where was help present?
Help is present in most of the code. Unfortunately no help was from my tutor, but I made sure to ask on different coding platforms and ask people that I know the correct questions in order to get help with my code. The idea of "help is present in most of the code" is basically that I looked for help for each bit of the code before I wrote it down. It was also a lot of testing before deploying it.
